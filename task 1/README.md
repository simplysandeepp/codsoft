🚀 MISA - Personal AI Assistant
Welcome to MISA (My Intelligent Smart Chatbot) — your personal chatbot and virtual assistant project!

🌡️ Temperature Converter GUI - Task 01
👨‍💻 Internship Project by Sandeep Prajapati
🏢 Company: CodSoft

✨ About This Project
I started by building a basic Command-Line Chatbot as part of a CodSoft task.
The goal was to create a simple interaction where a user could chat with a bot, ask questions, and perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, etc.

Later, I expanded this project into a more realistic AI Assistant using NLP concepts, external APIs, and a beautiful web interface for a more natural experience.
This shift represents my move from beginner scripting to real-world AI applications.
